 * Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point. Donâ€™t forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive â€œPresentation Errorâ€?. Donâ€™t forget the space before and after the equal sign.

Input
The input file contains 2 floating points' values with one digit after the decimal point.

Output
Print the message "MEDIA"(average in Portuguese) and the student's average according to the following example, with 5 digits after the decimal point and with a blank space before and after the equal signal.
